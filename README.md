# Test route annotation performance
Generate as many Controllers as you want via the command:
```bash
$ bin/console app: <<num>>
```

The template is hardcoded in the Command, and you can edit it to switch between annotations and attributes

Re-running the command will delete previously generated Controllers and create a new batch.
